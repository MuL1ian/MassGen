# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->
# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

<!-- OPENSPEC:END -->

## Planning
When planning or creating specs, use AskUserQuestions to ensure you align with the user before creating full planning files.

## Instruction File Parity

`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are required to stay identical in this repo.

- Pre-commit hook `sync-agent-instructions` auto-syncs them.
- If both files are edited differently in one change, resolve manually so they match exactly.

## Debugging Assumptions

**IMPORTANT**: When the user asks you to check logs from a MassGen run, assume they ran with the current uncommitted changes unless they explicitly say otherwise. Do NOT assume "the run used an older commit" just because the execution_metadata.yaml shows a different git commit - the user likely ran with local modifications after you suggested changes. Always debug the actual code behavior first.

## Implementation Guidelines

After implementing any feature that involves passing parameters through multiple layers (e.g., backend -> manager -> component), always verify the full wiring chain end-to-end by tracing the parameter from its origin to its final usage site. Do not rely solely on unit tests passing -- add an integration smoke test or assertion that the parameter actually arrives at its destination, not just that the downstream logic works when the parameter is provided.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No keyword/heuristic matching for categorization or similarity.** Avoid writing code that infers categories, detects similarity, or organizes content using keyword lists, Jaccard similarity, Levenshtein distance, or similar heuristics. These approaches are brittle and produce low-quality results. Use LLM-based approaches instead -- that's the whole point of this project.
- **No explicit tool call syntax in prompts.** Do not hardcode specific tool/function call syntax (e.g., `tool_name(param="value")`) in system prompts, skill instructions, or user-facing text. Models determine the correct calling convention from tool schemas. Describe what the agent should do in natural language instead. Hardcoded syntax is fragile across providers and couples prompts to implementation details.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**TDD is the default development methodology for this project.** With 121 test files and 1580+ tests across unit, integration, frontend, and snapshot layers, the test infrastructure is mature. All non-trivial work MUST follow the TDD cycle.

### The TDD Contract

For every non-trivial change (bug fix, new feature, refactor, backend change, TUI work, WebUI work), follow this sequence **in order**:

1. **Agree on acceptance tests first.** Before writing any production code, align with the user on what tests will prove the change works. Define pass/fail criteria explicitly.
2. **Write the tests.** Implement or update tests that express the desired behavior. These tests MUST fail initially -- if they pass before you write production code, either the tests are wrong or the feature already exists.
3. **Confirm tests fail for the right reason.** Run the tests and verify they fail because the feature/fix is missing, not because of a test bug.
4. **Implement the minimum code to pass.** Write production code until the test suite passes. Do not add untested behavior.
5. **Refactor under green.** Clean up only while all tests remain green.
6. **Commit tests alongside code.** Tests are not throwaway scaffolding -- they are permanent regression protection.

### When to Apply TDD

| Change Type | TDD Required? | Rationale |
|-------------|:---:|-----------|
| New feature / capability | **Yes** | Define behavior before implementing it |
| Bug fix | **Yes** | Write a test that reproduces the bug first |
| Backend changes | **Yes** | Test across affected backends |
| TUI behavior changes | **Yes** | Use snapshot, golden, or event pipeline tests |
| WebUI changes | **Yes** | Vitest unit + Playwright E2E as appropriate |
| Refactoring | **Yes** | Ensure existing tests pass before AND after |
| Config/YAML changes | **Yes** | Validate with config validation tests |
| Trivial one-liner fixes (typos, imports) | No | Use judgment -- but when in doubt, test |

### What "Non-Trivial" Means

If you're tempted to skip tests, ask: *"Could this break silently?"* If the answer is anything other than a confident "no," write a test. Specifically:
- Any change touching `orchestrator.py`, `chat_agent.py`, `backend/*.py`, `mcp_tools/`, or `coordination_tracker.py` is always non-trivial.
- Any change to TUI widgets, content handlers, or event processing is always non-trivial.
- Any change to system prompts, config validation, or YAML parsing is always non-trivial.

### Test Placement

| Test Type | Location | When to Use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Unit tests | `massgen/tests/` or `massgen/tests/unit/` | Isolated logic, single-component |
| Integration tests | `massgen/tests/integration/` | Multi-component orchestration flows |
| Frontend/TUI tests | `massgen/tests/frontend/` | Widget, snapshot, golden transcript |
| WebUI tests | `webui/src/**/*.test.ts` | Store, component, E2E |

### Anti-Patterns (Do NOT Do These)

- **Implement first, test later.** This inverts the TDD cycle and leads to tests that confirm what was written rather than what was intended.
- **Skip tests "because it's small."** Small changes cause big regressions. The test suite exists to catch exactly these.
- **Write tests that always pass.** A test that can't fail is not a test. Always verify the red-green cycle.
- **Test only the happy path.** Cover edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values.
- **Rely on manual testing.** If you tested it by running `massgen --automation`, also encode that expectation as an automated test.

## Project Overview

MassGen is a multi-agent system that coordinates multiple AI agents to solve complex tasks through parallel processing, intelligence sharing, and consensus building. Agents work simultaneously, observe each other's progress, and vote to converge on the best solution.

### Design Principles: The Quality Matrix

MassGen's strength comes from two orthogonal dimensions working together:

|                        | **Parallel** (same task, N agents) | **Decomposition** (subtasks, owned) |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Enforcing Refinement** | Agents iterate until quality is genuinely achieved, not just adequate | Each subtask owner refines until their piece meets quality gates |
| **Ensuring Depth in Roles** | Strong personas give agents distinct creative visions, producing diverse high-quality attempts | Persona specialization ensures deep domain fit per subtask |

- **Enforcing refinement** (currently: checklist-gated voting, gap analysis, improvements echo) = controls *how much* agents iterate and ensures each iteration is *worth it*. Multiple agents are key here: each round's evaluator sees all agents' prior answers, can identify unique strengths across them, and synthesizes the best elements into the next attempt. Without refinement, agents settle for "good enough."
- **Ensuring depth in roles** = persona/role generation that gives agents strong opinionated visions. A bare user prompt is rarely enough for quality output -- the persona fills in the creative direction. Consider using a preliminary MassGen call to generate rich personas/briefs before the main execution run.

Neither dimension alone is sufficient. Refinement without strong roles produces polished mediocrity. Strong roles without refinement produces ambitious first drafts that never mature.

## Essential Commands

All commands use `uv run` prefix:

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest massgen/tests/                           # All tests
uv run pytest massgen/tests/test_specific.py -v        # Single test file
uv run pytest massgen/tests/test_file.py::test_name -v # Single test

# Run MassGen (ALWAYS use --automation for programmatic execution)
uv run massgen --automation --config [config.yaml] "question"

# Build documentation
cd docs && make html                    # Build docs
cd docs && make livehtml                # Auto-reload dev server at localhost:8000

# Pre-commit checks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Validate all configs
uv run python scripts/validate_all_configs.py

# Build Web UI (required after modifying webui/src/*)
cd webui && npm run build
```

## Architecture Overview

Core flow, key components, backend hierarchy, agent statelessness, and TUI design principles. Full guide: `docs/modules/architecture.md`.

        coordination_tracker.py (voting, consensus)
                |
        mcp_tools/ (tool execution)
```

```text

    +-- base_with_custom_tool_and_mcp.py (tool + MCP support)
            |-- response.py (OpenAI Response API)
            |-- chat_completions.py (generic OpenAI-compatible)
            |-- claude.py (Anthropic)
            |-- claude_code.py (Claude Code SDK)
            |-- gemini.py (Google)
            +-- grok.py (xAI)
```

## Configuration

YAML configs in `massgen/configs/` define agent setups. Structure:
- `basic/` - Simple single/multi-agent configs
- `tools/` - MCP, filesystem, code execution configs
- `providers/` - Provider-specific examples
- `teams/` - Pre-configured specialized teams

When adding new YAML parameters, update **both**:
- `massgen/backend/base.py` -> `get_base_excluded_config_params()`
- `massgen/api_params_handler/_api_params_handler_base.py` -> `get_base_excluded_config_params()`

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **TDD is the default.** Every non-trivial task starts with tests. See the [TDD section above](#test-driven-development-tdd) for the full contract. Do not skip this -- if you find yourself writing production code before tests, stop and reverse course.
2. **Run tests early and often.** After each meaningful code change, run the relevant test subset. Do not batch up changes and test at the end.
3. **Keep PR_DRAFT.md updated** - Create a PR_DRAFT.md that references each new feature with corresponding Linear (e.g., `Closes MAS-XXX`) and GitHub issue numbers. Keep this updated as new features are added. You may need to ask the user whether to overwrite or append to this file. Ensure you include test cases here as well as configs used to test them.
4. **Review PRs** with `pr-checks` skill.
5. **Git staging**: Use `git add -u .` for modified tracked files

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation must be consistent with implementation, concise, and usable. Full guide with per-PR tables, quality standards, and file locations: `docs/modules/documentation.md`.

## Registry Updates

Checklists for adding new models and new YAML parameters. Full guide: `docs/modules/registry.md`. Key rule: when adding YAML params, update both `base.py` and `_api_params_handler_base.py` exclusion lists.

## CodeRabbit Integration

Automated PR reviews via CodeRabbit. Full guide: `docs/modules/code_review.md`. Quick command: `coderabbit --prompt-only`.

## Custom Tools

Tools in `massgen/tool/` require `TOOL.md` with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: tool-name
description: One-line description
category: primary-category
requires_api_keys: [OPENAI_API_KEY]  # or []
tasks:
  - "Task this tool can perform"
keywords: [keyword1, keyword2]
---
```

Docker execution mode auto-excludes tools missing required API keys.

## Testing Notes

Full testing strategy, markers, commands, snapshot workflow, and backend testing patterns: `docs/modules/testing.md`.

```bash
# Fast local suite (PR gate)
uv run pytest massgen/tests --run-integration -m "not live_api and not docker and not expensive" -q --tb=short

# Just unit tests
uv run pytest massgen/tests/ -q --tb=short

# Integration tests (deterministic, non-costly)

## MassGen Skills

Specialized skills in `massgen/skills/` for common workflows. Full guide: `docs/modules/skills.md`. Symlink to `.claude/skills/` for discovery.

## Linear Integration

This project uses Linear for issue tracking.

### Setup (if Linear tools unavailable)

If `mcp__linear-server__*` tools aren't available:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http linear-server https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```

### Feature Workflow

1. **Create Linear issue first** -> `mcp__linear-server__create_issue`
2. **For significant changes** -> Create OpenSpec proposal referencing the issue
3. **Implement** -> Reference issue ID in commits
4. **Update status** -> `mcp__linear-server__update_issue`

This ensures features are tracked in Linear and spec'd via OpenSpec before implementation.

*Note*: When using Linear, ensure you use the MassGen project and prepend '[FEATURE]', '[DOCS]', '[BUG]', or '[ROADMAP]' to the issue name. By default, set issues as 'Todo'.

## Release Workflow

Automated GitHub Actions, release-prep skill, announcement files, and full release process. Full guide: `docs/modules/release.md`. Quick command: `release-prep v0.1.XX`.
