# Recommended fields:
# - link: issue/PR URL or internal tracker reference
# - expires: YYYY-MM-DD (forces revisit; can be enforced with --xfail-expired-fail or XFAIL_EXPIRED_FAIL=1)

# Example:
# massgen/tests/test_some_feature.py::TestClass::test_case:

# --- Seeded xfails (initial triage baseline) ---
# These are intentionally short-lived to keep the suite actionable while we delegate cluster fixes.

# REMOVED: test_vhs_installed now uses @requires_vhs skipif decorator
# REMOVED: test_run_with_single_model and test_run_with_models_list already use @pytest.mark.expensive

# REMOVED: test_image_within_limits and test_image_dimension_limit now pass (fixed in v0.1.29)

# REMOVED: test_persistent_memory tests now pass (Qdrant issues resolved)
